Changes
=======

0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Windows 7 support.

- Python 2.5 supported; because it only needed a __future__ import.

- Python 3.3 tested, it worked.

- Got rid of relative imports, because I don't actually like them, 
  so I don't know why I used them in the first place.
  

0.2 (2012-09-12)
----------------

- Python 3 support.


0.1 (2012-09-11)
